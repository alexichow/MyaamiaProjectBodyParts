# MyaamiaProjectBodyParts
v1.0 of the body parts template developed for the Myaamia Project at Miami University.

The final version can be found here: http://www.myaamiacenter.org/MCResources/modules/cse/bodyparts2012/

## Obtaining Files

`git clone https://github.com/alexichow/MyaamiaProjectBodyParts`

## Usage

`Main_Page_Torso.html` is the home page and will link to the others. 

Cube 1 is the 'Observe' page. It will cycle through the body parts with 'Ni' (my), 'Ki' (your), and 'A' (his/her) pronouns.

Cube 2 is the 'Try' page. You can click the different body parts to have the audio play for them. The NiKiA cube can be used to change between the different pronouns.

Cube 3 is the 'Test' page. An audio file will be played and the user is to identify which body part it refers to. A correct response shows a checkmark and an incorrect response shows a red 'X'.
